# These groups exist because of the ability to share the same process of
# subscribing the physical and virtual machines to RHSM, activating
# subscriptions and repositories, and updating packages.
#
# Because the only RHEL VM is actually the services VM, all RHEL stuff could
# actually be moved to just the ocp_rhel group, but the breakdown is kept
# around because of the additional hypervisor setup option.
#
# Have a look at corresponding group_vars files to configure subscriptions, but
# basically the trick is this:
#   - rhel is the top level group: use it for RHSM credentials at least
#   - if you use the same subscription for all VMs, set the pools there as well
#   - otherwise, set the subscription pools on a per-group basis
#   - in any case, set up repositories to enable on a per-rhel-version basis
#
# The important bit is to keep ocp_rhel group inside rhel8.

# This is the target system to deploy the cluster to. ***SINGULAR***
#
# NOTE: the way the playbooks are written right now, by placing more than one
# host into this group, you will actually get several identical services VM
# deployments, but afterwards, we can't proceed.
#
# We would need to be able to delegate services VM provisioning to *all* of the
# services VMs, which is simply not possible, because by definition, all of
# them are on different hosts, but all of them have the same IP, which makes up
# for a very very nice networking mess, if nothing else.
#
# UNSUPPORTED: Put your hypervisor systems here if you want to manage them with
# playbooks. There is a full libvirt configuration procedure there, but it
# unfortunately expects the system to be dedicated and freshly installed from
# scratch.
